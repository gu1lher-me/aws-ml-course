# statistical-distributions-package

This package was developed following the material from the AWS Machine Learning Foundations Nanodegree Program, given in partnership with Udacity. It was written in python, following object-oriented programming standards.

This package has a Distribution class, which is used in the construction of the Gaussian and binomial distribution classes. It is possible to read data from a .txt file in order to obtain the respective Gaussian and binomial distributions, besides plotting the distributions and calculating the associated probability density function. 

It is recommended that the user installs and uses this package in a virtual environment, for instance using the venv or conda packages.
